We have test several combinations of associativity and sets, we think 4-ways
is the best case, area decreases significantly with around 30 percents decrease
in performance, while area is one of the biggest concern, we choose 4-way as the
best case.

The chip finish and ptsi timing files are for 4-ways, 16KB. However, although we change the timing
constraint, the setup time is still violated, have no idead to fix, and no time left.
